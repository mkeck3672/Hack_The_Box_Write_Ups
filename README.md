<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to my github!! :smile: </h2>

My name is Mike and my hacker handle is Thugbounty. I am here to get better at Pen-testing. I currently work for a Security company and handle vulnerability reports for my clients. I have a degree in Cyber Security but I have only started putting the skills to work a little over a year ago. My goals are simple I want to be a great security researcher and Pen-tester. I plan on doing this through hack the box, try hack me, proving grounds and other programs. I will also be looking to do testing on live targets however due to NDAs I cant share those exploits. As I grow I will be updating my repo with anything that can help others with their careers/hobbies.

Join me in my adventure to become the best!

Cheers!
